        <p>Cooking noodles is a great skill for any beginner. Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for making basic noodles with a savory sauce:
            <ul>Ingredients:
                <li>8 ounces (about 225 grams) of dried noodles (spaghetti, egg noodles, or any type you prefer)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
                <li>1 cup (240 ml) of low-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar or white vinegar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional for heat)</li>
                <li>2 green onions, sliced (optional for garnish)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional for garnish)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Equipment:
                <li>A large pot</li>
                <li>A colande</li>
                <li>A large skillet or wok</li>
                <li>A small bowl</li>
                <li>A spoon or whisk</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Instructions:
                <li>Cook the Noodles: <br>

                    Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add a pinch of salt if you like. <br>
                    Once boiling, add the dried noodles and cook according to the package instructions (usually around 8-10 minutes) until they are tender but still firm. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. <br>
                    When cooked, drain the noodles in a colander and rinse them briefly with cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Sauce: <br>

                    In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Cook the Aromatics: <br>

                    Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. <br>
                    If using garlic, add it to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
                <li>Combine Everything: <br>

                    Add the cooked noodles to the skillet with the garlic. Stir to coat the noodles with the oil and garlic. <br>
                    Pour the prepared sauce over the noodles. Toss everything together to ensure the noodles are evenly coated and heated through. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>

                <li>Garnish and Serve: <br>

Transfer the noodles to a serving dish. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds if desired</li>
            </ul> <br>And that’s it! You’ve made a quick and tasty noodle dish. Enjoy it as a main course or as a side with your favorite proteins and vegetables.
