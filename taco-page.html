                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>Taco shells or tortillas (store-bought)</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
                <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or Mexican blend)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream (optional)</li>
                <li>Salsa (optional)</li>
                <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Homemade Taco Seasoning (Optional):
                <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Instructions:
                <li>Cook the Vegetables: <br>

                    Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Add the chopped onion and cook for about 2 minutes, until it’s soft and translucent.
                    Add the diced red bell pepper and zucchini. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
                    
                <li>Add Beans and Seasoning: <br>

                    Stir in the black beans.
                    If using a taco seasoning packet, add it now. If using homemade seasoning, mix the seasoning ingredients together and add them to the skillet.
                    Pour in 1/2 cup of water and stir well to combine everything. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and most of the water evaporates. Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Toppings: <br>

                    While the mixture is cooking, prepare your taco toppings. Dice the tomatoes, shred the lettuce, and grate the cheese if needed.</li>
                <li>Warm the Taco Shells: <br>

                    If using taco shells, warm them according to the package instructions (usually 5 minutes in a preheated oven at 350°F or 2 minutes in the microwave).</li>
                <li>Assemble the Tacos: <br>

                    Spoon the bean and vegetable mixture into each taco shell or tortilla.
                    Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese.
                    Add a dollop of sour cream and salsa if you like, and garnish with fresh cilantro if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve and Enjoy: <br>

                    Serve your tacos immediately while they’re warm and enjoy!</li>
                
            </ul> And that’s it! You’ve made a quick and tasty taco dish. Enjoy it as a main course or as a side with your favorite proteins and vegetables.
