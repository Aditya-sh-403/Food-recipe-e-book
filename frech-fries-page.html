       <p>Making French fries at home is simple and fun, even for a complete beginner. Here’s a straightforward recipe to get you crispy, delicious fries every time:
        <ul>Ingredients:
            <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil (like canola or sunflower)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional: pepper, paprika, garlic powder, or any other seasonings you like</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Equipment:
            <li>A large bowl</li>
            <li>A sharp knife</li>
            <li>A cutting board</li>
            <li>A baking sheet</li>
            <li>Paper towels</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Instructions:
            <li>Prepare the Potatoes: <br>

                Start by washing the potatoes under cold water. You can peel them if you prefer, but leaving the skin on adds extra texture and flavor.
                On a cutting board, cut each potato into thin strips. Aim for about 1/4 inch thick to ensure even cooking.
                </li>
                <li>Soak the Potatoes: <br>

                    Place the potato strips in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This step removes excess starch and helps the fries become crispier</li>
                    <li>Preheat Your Oven: <br>

                        While the potatoes are soaking, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
                        <li>Dry and Season: <br>

                            After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels. Removing excess moisture is key to getting crispy fries.
                            In a large bowl, toss the dried potato strips with vegetable oil. Ensure they are well-coated but not swimming in oil.</li>
                            <li>Bake the Fries: <br>

                                Spread the potato strips in a single layer on a baking sheet. Make sure they are not crowded; this helps them crisp up evenly.
                                Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Halfway through, flip the fries to ensure they cook evenly on all sides.</li>
                                <li>Season and Serve: <br>

                                    Once the fries are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the oven. While they’re still hot, sprinkle with salt and any other seasonings you like.</li>
                                    <li>Enjoy: <br>

                                        Serve your homemade fries hot with ketchup, mayo, or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        </ul> <br>
        And that’s it! Homemade French fries are a tasty treat that’s easy to make and perfect for any occasion.
