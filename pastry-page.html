        <p>A flaky, buttery pastry with a golden crust, filled with rich, velvety cream and a hint of vanilla. Every bite melts in your mouth, offering a delightful, sweet indulgence.
            <ul>Ingredients:
                <li>1 sheet of frozen puff pastry (store-bought)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fruit jam or preserves (such as raspberry, apricot, or strawberry)</li>
                <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional, for sprinkling)</li>
                
            </ul>
            <ul>Instructions:
                <li>Thaw the Puff Pastry: <br>

                    Take the frozen puff pastry sheet out of the freezer and let it thaw at room temperature for about 20-30 minutes, or according to the package instructions. It should be soft but still cold.</li>
                <li>Preheat the Oven: <br>

                    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Pastry: <br>

                    Unfold the thawed puff pastry sheet on a clean surface. If it is rolled, gently roll it out with a rolling pin to smooth it out and make it slightly thinner (about 1/8 inch thick).</li>
                <li>Cut and Fill: <br>

                    Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut the pastry sheet into squares or rectangles, about 3 inches by 3 inches. You can cut it into larger or smaller pieces depending on your preference.
                    Place a small teaspoon of fruit jam in the center of each square or rectangle. Be careful not to overfill, as the jam can ooze out during baking.</li>
                <li>Fold and Seal: <br>

                    Fold each square or rectangle in half diagonally to form a triangle, or fold the edges in to create a small parcel or turnover shape.
                    Press the edges together firmly to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch and to ensure they are sealed well.</li>
                <li>Apply Egg Wash: <br>

                    Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat it lightly. Brush the egg wash over the top of each pastry. This gives the pastries a golden, shiny finish as they bake.
                    If desired, sprinkle a little sugar on top of each pastry for extra sweetness and a crisp texture.</li>
                <li>Bake: <br>

                    Place the prepared pastries on the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until they are puffed up and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Cool and Serve: <br>

                    Allow the pastries to cool on a wire rack for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature.</li>
            </ul>
