            <ul>Ingredients:
                <li>12 oz (340 g) pasta (spaghetti, penne, or your choice)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 can (15 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
                <li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Instructions:
                <li>Cook the Pasta: <br>

                    Fill a large pot with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat.
                    Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions (usually 8-12 minutes) until al dente (tender but slightly firm). Stir occasionally.
                    Drain the pasta in a colander and set aside.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Sauce: <br>

                    While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
                    Add the chopped onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes, until it becomes soft and translucent.
                    Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>Add Tomatoes and Seasonings: <br>

                    Pour in the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. Stir well.
                    Add the dried basil, dried oregano, and sugar. Mix everything together.
                    Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
                    Bring the sauce to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: <br>

                    Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.
                    Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the pasta to heat through and absorb the flavors.</li>
                <li>Serve: <br>

                    Transfer the pasta to serving plates.
                    Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
                    Garnish with fresh basil leaves if you like.</li>
