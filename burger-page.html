                <li>Prepare the Patties: <br>

                    Boil the potatoes in a pot of water until tender. Drain and mash them in a large bowl.
                    In a pan, heat 1 tbsp oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, and let them splutter.
                    Add finely chopped mixed vegetables to the pan and saut√© for 5 minutes until they are cooked.
                    Add turmeric powder, garam masala, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.
                    Combine the cooked vegetables with the mashed potatoes. Add fresh coriander and mix thoroughly.
                    If the mixture is too soft, add bread crumbs for binding and grated paneer for richness. Shape into 4 patties.</li>

                    Slice the burger buns in half.

                <li>Assemble the Burger: <br>

                    Spread mint chutney or tamarind chutney on the bottom half of each bun.
                    Place a lettuce leaf, a patty, a slice of tomato, cucumber, and onion on top.
