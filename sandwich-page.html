            A hearty sandwich layers tender, roasted turkey, crisp lettuce, juicy tomatoes, and creamy avocado between slices of freshly baked whole grain bread, seasoned with a hint of mustard for a satisfying, flavorful bite.
            <ul>Ingredients:
                <li>2 slices of whole grain or white bread</li>
                <li>2-3 slices of deli turkey</li>
                <li>1 slice of cheddar cheese (or your favorite cheese)</li>
                <li>2-3 leaves of lettuce</li>
                <li>2 tomato slices</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise (optional)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon mustard (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                
            </ul>
            <ul>Instructions:


                <li>Prepare the Ingredients: <br>

                    Wash the lettuce leaves under cold water and pat them dry with a paper towel.
                    Rinse and slice the tomato into thin rounds.
                    If youâ€™re using store-bought cheese and deli turkey, no additional preparation is needed.</li>
                <li>Toast the Bread (Optional): <br>

                    If you prefer toasted bread, place the slices in a toaster or toaster oven and toast until golden brown. This step adds a nice crunch but is optional.</li>
                <li>Spread the Condiments: <br>

                    Lay the two slices of bread on a clean surface, such as a plate or cutting board.
                    If using mayonnaise and mustard, spread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on one slice of bread and 1 teaspoon of mustard on the other slice. Adjust the amounts to your taste.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Sandwich: <br>

                    On the slice of bread with mayonnaise, layer the turkey slices evenly. Place 2-3 slices of turkey to cover the bread completely.
                    Next, place the slice of cheese on top of the turkey.
                    Add the lettuce leaves on top of the cheese.
                    Layer the tomato slices over the lettuce. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper if desired.
                    </li>
                <li>Complete the Sandwich: <br>

                    Place the second slice of bread (with mustard) on top of the tomatoes, condiment side down.
                    Press down gently to help the ingredients meld together.</li>
                <li>Cut and Serve: <br>

                    Use a knife to cut the sandwich diagonally or in half, depending on your preference.
                    Serve immediately or wrap it up for a quick and easy lunch on the go.</li>
                
            </ul>
